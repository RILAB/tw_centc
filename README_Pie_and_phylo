Chromosome Specificity Pie Charts

THE ORIGINAL DNA DISTANCE MATRIX IS ON FARM, AT ~/centc/Genetic_Distance/B73v2_centc_dnadist

Guidelines of how the across chromosome analyses were performed.

Step 1- Gather the JC distance matrix from PHYLIP

	Data is on the cluster, made with all default parameters.  **dnadist**

Step 2- Make the NJ tree in PHYLIP

	Use the JC distance matrix from phylip to build an outtree with **neighbor**
	
Step 3- Generate the Tree

	**neighbor** will generate a file called outtree, use that newick file and figtree to make your tree
	
Step 4- Label the groups, extract names.

	Color each of the groups accordingly in figtree
	Export the colored Figtree as a nexus.  It will have the whole tree in one line with the colors attached to each taxa.
	Take that wholetree in a line, and make it a separate file, Chr_color_perline.txt for example.
	To parse the line so that each centc is on its own line, use:
		perl FigTree_color_parse.pl shortoutput.txt > All_chr_in_tree
	Take this file, and make the lines that have 2 centc's into 2 lines, should be 5 instances
		makes the new file, Chr_color_perline.txt
	Grep out each color:
		grep "3355444" Chr_color_perline.txt > Color_3355444.txt
		where the number corresponds to each color
		you can pinpoint which color is which by just searching for a CentC with a given color, and seeing which clade it pops out by.
	Do this for all of the colors so they are in their own files.
	
Step 5- Count the number of hits from each chromosome.

	grep -c "chr01" Color_*
	this will show the count of each chr in each of the color files.
	Manipulate these numbers into a CSV in R.
	Load the CSV and make the pie charts with R!
